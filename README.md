# Integrated CLI DJ'ing Environment

Scan folder and sub-folders for all audio &amp; video, cache results, then play random selection.

Previously [I published a script](https://michaelzfreeman.org/linux-cli-bash-play-random-audio-file-music-track-or-display-random-image/) that selected a random audio file (or any file). However it assumed that the folder where you have your files is exclusively filled with audio file types. As a DJ I save mixes to a folder along with text and HTML files that hold the track list. It was getting a little laborious having to re-trigger the script over and over until I hit an actual audio file. So I wrote a script that actually checks the file MIME type. The script also has added colour and emojiâ€™s for humanity factor 100% ðŸ¤±!

# The Next Level

While tinkering with this script I noticed it was becoming VASTLY easier for me to select tracks, experiment and DJ at the command line. However mpv has a very unsophisticed pitch control and other functions. Then I discovered [Alsaplayer](http://alsaplayer.sourceforge.net/) and paradise was regained ... (sadly only briefly, see below) ! That has a fully functional pitch control as well as reverse andd loop points. This in a way starts replicating the SIMPLICITY of the tried and tested two vinyl record decks and a mixer with two faders and a cross fader. That's all that is needed and has been the basis of all DJ selecting and/or creative DJ'ing over the last 60 years. The tech has become horribly complex both software and hardware with manufacturers all vying for your attention with a veritable typhoon of features and technocratic solutions. 

But lo, your saviour is at hand ! The Integrated CLI DJ'ing Environment will free you from your bondage, your slavery. The Matrix of stifling and boring music and DJ'ing "solutions" will be rent asunder and the JOY and LOVE inherent in the music will come pouring out. A'men.

# Alsaplayer

Alsaplayer fits the bill but its very buggy sadly and with very little development going. Currently I'm looking at Mixxx although that takes us back to more complexity again.
